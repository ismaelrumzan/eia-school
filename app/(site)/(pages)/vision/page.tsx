      <H1>Design Philosophy and Vision</H1>
      <H2 className="pt-2">A design that expresses Islamic ideals</H2>
      <H3>Supporting Islamic education deeply</H3>
      <section className="prose max-w-none">
        <p>
          In Islam the vision of Paradise is imagined and aspired to in Qur’anic
          descriptions. For over a millennia Muslims all over the world have
          also sought to manifest Paradise on earth – through garden design but
          also in manuscripts, representation of tawhid in geometric patterning,
          representations of Paradise on rugs, mosaics and in mosques. Entrance
          to Paradise is by way of practicing the pillars of the faith (prayer,
          fasting, charity, hajj, shahada) in life, and in death by way of
          ongoing charity, beneficial knowledge and virtuous offspring praying
          for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of the design of the AMA school is manifest Paradise present
          in the ways mentioned above and in three particular approaches:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Orientation to Mecca of all classrooms, so that learning is facing
            Mecca and prayers in the classroom are immediate and comfortable; 
          </li>
          <li>
            Appropriate geometry unifying the design and decoration will assist
            with identity and wayfinding and large scale text of the shahada and
            five pillars of Islam will adorn the building
          </li>
          <li>
            Environmental stewardship and care for the sacred earth created by
            Allah will be a part of the education spaces and the spaces
            surrounding the school: with sustainable and passive design
            strategies students will understand and use the small gardens and
            sitting areas for each classroom commons area and the garden area
            behind the glass mihrab wall in the mosque.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In addition to this the mosque space will open up to adjacent
          multi-purpose rooms to accommodate all of the students and staff to
          pray together on special occasions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Al Rashid mosque is the oldest extant mosque in Canada, and in
          nearly the century since, the Muslim community in Edmonton has
          expanded and now the current Al Rashid mosque and AMA school serve as
          important hubs of community endeavours and both are also pioneering in
          expressing Canadian Muslim spaces. The new AMA will accomplish the
          needs of the expanded school in terms of space and application of
          Islamic ideals including environmental stewardship and care for the
          earth. By looking to the ground as a site for prayer and the earth
          that is cultivated in a treasured way, and by looking up to the stars
          from the beacon of the minaret the AMA school spaces will express in
          design, Islamic ideals and will support Islamic education in an
          advanced and unique way.
